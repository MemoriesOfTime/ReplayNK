`ReplayNK` is a camera plugin developed for the Bedrock Edition server software `PowerNukkitX`, based on the latest Camera API of MCBE 1.20.0  
This repository is a modified version compatible with `Nukkit-MOT`.

`ReplayNK` has made a lot of optimizations for camera movement, making its camera movement smoother and smoother than the traditional `/teleport`command plus command block to achieve camera movement

`ReplayNK` perfectly supports all available parameters of the original `/camera` command, and adds a series of smoothing algorithms for path smoothing, such as Bézier curves.

`ReplayNK` is simple and intuitive to use, with full visual operation, and most of the functions can be activated with one click of a button. At the same time, the plugin supports Chinese and English dual languages, and will automatically switch according to the user's language settings.

## Troubleshooting

Q: Why do I feel that the camera is still stuck?

A: Due to the limitation of the client, when the speed of the mirror is too high and the distance between the markers is too small, there will be a freeze phenomenon. We have optimized it as much as possible. You can improve this problem by reducing the camera speed or increasing the marker spacing

Q: Why doesn't my camera reset after playback ends?

A: This may be caused by sending packets too fast. You can fix this by using the command `camera @s clear`
